**** each cell has a value cursor
     the value of this is displayed when the cell is unfocused.  this is what
     other cells watch.
**** each element also has a private source text
     this gets remembered across edits. this is internal to the cell.
**** each element *with formula* also has a ratom or r/track
***** watches the value cursors of input cells it depends on
***** updates its own value cursor on changes
***** this ratom is not watched by anyone else, so it can be internal to the component
      XXX we may need to make it global for cycle detection
***** we can dispose of any existing one when we update the formula
